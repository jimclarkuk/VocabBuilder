Vocab Builder Project
=====================

### Why?

I am learning Spanish and trying to properly learn
30 words a week or so. I wanted an application that
would allow me to input the vocab myself so I can 
select the words I am doing and also the ability to 
organise by category. 

So, I should be able to look at all words from 
week X or all words from category Y.

Then when I show the words I want to be able to hide
one of the languages, show all, or accept input as 
a test. This is the basic idea for now.
